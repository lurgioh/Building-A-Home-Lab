Default settings for VM are NAT
-NAT can access the LAN it gives each virtual machine its own network for example
-Network 1: 10.0.1.0/24 
-Network 2: 10.0.2.0/24
-Network 3: 10.0.3.0/24

NAT Network
-Give access to internet but meshes all the virtual boxes into one network

Bridged
-access to the internet it connects your VMs act as real machines meaning it will be on the same network as your host machine

Host-Only Network
-No internet access nor will it have access to lan

Internal Network
- puts the virtual machines into there own network and they will not have access to the lan

Not attached
-Network adapter is not attached

Next is setting up the virtual machines to stay safe while testing malware
-Went into settings on Vitrual Box into network settings and assigned both VMS to internal network under "MyTest"
